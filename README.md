# Google Cloud Platform Serverless Store

A sample e-commerce page powered by the Google Cloud Platform and Stripe for payments.

**Demo**

The hosted demo is running in test mode -- use `4242424242424242` as a test card number with any CVC + future expiration date.


This sample shows you how to:
* Host a simple digital goods page
* Build an ecommerce example with Stripe + GCP

## How to run locally
You will need a Stripe account with its own set of [API keys](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys) from your Stripe Dashboard or through the [API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans/create).
